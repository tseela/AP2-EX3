### Tal & Tse'ela
This is our simulator application. Here, we can control a flight using our app.

## How Does It Work?
We have two seekbars controlling the rudder and the throttle of the flight and a joystick controlling the aileron and the elevator of the flight.
The user can control those three objects and this way he controls the flight's direction.
In order to do that, the user will need to connect to a running simulator, using it's IP and PORT.
## Architecture
We used MVVM architecture for our single screen, implementing view (acticity_main.xml & MainActivity.java), view model and model.
